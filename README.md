### 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me

💡 &nbsp;I have more than 10 plus years of IT Business and Life Experience :).\
🎓 &nbsp;I'm currently undergoing Masters in Data Science and Machine Learning with Liverpool John Moores University with edtech partner Upgrad.\
🌱 &nbsp;I'm looking to solve typical ecommerce and consumer marketing problems in that value chain and using data and machine learning. I am in the process to enhance and build domain knowledge and typical Data and ML skills necessary to solve such problems. \
✍️ &nbsp;Before stepping into the world of data science with consumer marketing I had my own start up dealing with Childrens Holistic Wellbeing. More details on the work we did here:(https://www.thehomecoming.org) and (https://fb.me/dhomecoming) \
✍️ &nbsp;To recharge my batteries I use yoga and yogic tools, hitting the gym, reading entrepreneurial and business books and off lately playing the Djembe(African Musical Instrument) \
💬 &nbsp;I am open to connect, have quality discussions and build network. I am mostly active on email and Facebook\
✉️ &nbsp;You can shoot me an email at achal.kagwad@gmail.com ! I'll try to respond as soon as I can.\
